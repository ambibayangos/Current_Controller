What the system should do ?

Initially the system does not know if the door is opened or not
thus to determine the state of the door a 50% duty cycle is provided.
	1. Here the current provided must be low to ensure the door will not be opened (if the door is closed)
	   (if the force provided is opening then if the door is opened the door should not move the door significantly)

If the door is detected to be opened the door should be able to detect
how fast the door is approaching.

If the door is sensed to be approaching fast the breaking force should be provided.
However if the door is approaching slowy the breaking force is not provided.

Onced the door position is sensed to be close to the door then the closing force
should be provided. (can the door be sensed for postion and speed at the same time using coil only?) 

This could be potentially dangerous(fingers could be caught on the door) so the closing force provided 
must be low and then gradually increase in able to make sure the door is shut properly.

1.) At 10% duty cycle the current of the coil at 0 deg and 40 deg are very similar
    (this could help with no config needed)
    
    10% duty cycle could be use to sense the position of the door because it uses smaller current
    and so it produces less force.
